Weekend To Do List

## Description

Created an app where you can write a list of things you need to do and check off the tasks as you are done and when delete a task when you dont need it anymore. It will turn a lighter shade of blue with a cross over it when you click the complete button. You are also able to click incomplete if you accidentally clicked complete and it will come back as incomplete task.

I ran to a lot of issues trying to get the buttons working, after doing some research and revisiting previous works I figured sometimes using more tags to get to where I want the click to happen will help more then trying to group a lot in at once.
